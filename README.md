# Class_Report

The Sales Report Generator is a JavaScript-based project that showcases fundamental programming concepts to process and analyze sales data. It uses a JSON-like data structure to store product information, calculates total sales for each product, and categorizes performance based on predefined criteria. This project is an excellent learning tool for those starting with JavaScript, as it incorporates several core concepts.

Key Features

Total Sales Calculation: Computes the total sales for each product by multiplying its quantity sold by the price per unit.
Performance Evaluation: Uses conditional statements to classify products into "Low Performance," "Medium Performance," or "High Performance" based on total sales.
Structured Data Handling: Employs objects and arrays to organize sales data efficiently.
Dynamic Output: Generates a formatted report using template literals, providing clear and concise insights for each product.
JSON Iteration: Demonstrates iteration over structured data to process and display results.

How It Works

Input Data: Sales data is structured in an array of objects, each containing product name, quantity sold, and price per unit.
Processing: A for loop iterates through the sales data, calculates total sales, and evaluates performance using a custom function.
Output: The report is printed to the console, showing details like product name, quantity sold, price per unit, total sales, and performance rating.

Learning Objectives
This project highlights fundamental JavaScript skills such as working with arrays, objects, functions, conditional statements, and iterating through data.
